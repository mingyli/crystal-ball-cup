## Project Structure and Build Process

This project uses `dune` for its build system. All files are generated by running `dune build`.

### Directories:

*   **`src/`**: Contains the core OCaml data structures and logic used throughout the project.
*   **`bin/`**: Contains the main executable. This executable has various subcommands that produce text files such as JSON and Markdown.
*   **`docs/`**: Contains project artifacts and the build rule for `index.html`. The `index.html` file is served by GitHub Pages and is generated from `index.md` according to the `dune` build rules within this directory. You can serve it locally by running `python3 -m http.server` from this directory.
*   **`etc/`**: Stores intermediate artifacts generated during the build process.
