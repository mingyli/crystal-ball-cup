## Project Structure and Build Process

This project uses `dune` for its build system. All files are generated by
running `dune build`.

### Directories:

*   **`src/`**: Contains the core OCaml data structures and logic used
    throughout the project.
*   **`bin/`**: Contains the main executable. This executable has various
    subcommands that produce text files such as JSON and Markdown.
*   **`docs/`**: Contains project artifacts and the build rule for
    `index.html`. The `index.html` file is served by GitHub Pages and is
    generated from `index.md` according to the `dune` build rules within this
    directory. You can serve it locally by running `python3 -m http.server`
    from this directory.
*   **`etc/`**: Stores miscellaneous assets for this project.

## sqlite plan

Let's plan a large change to serve a sqlite database in the web page. The 
database will have the following tables in order to replace the data currently
served by the json files:

- events
  - schema: event_id, short, precise, outcome
- responses
  - schema: respondent, event_id, probability 
- scores
  - schema: respondent, event_id, score

The steps involved in this change are

1. Implement subcommand to create and populate the sqlite database 
2. Update the web page to support interacting with the database
